For each example used to generate HPA, there are usually two input files, one named as #file(.txt) is for single process, the other named as #file_p(.txt) or #file_property(.txt) is for property.
Image files (e.g. .png, .jpg files) are only for visualization and debugging, not input nor output of the tool.
The folder "op" inside each example stores previous generated intermediate files.

Files named with prefix "HPA_" are HPA files valid as input of Part 2 of the HPA Demo tool.
If you cares only about the verification algorithms, ignore Part 1 and go to Part 2 directly.
Load a HPA file from examples or write your own one, then play!

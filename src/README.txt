There are 2 folders in the "src" folder, and they are both needed for compiling the project.
- "src" contains the source code of the HPA Dem Tool, which is written in Java. "UI/UI.java" is the entry point.
- "lib" contains external libraries that should be included in Build Path for compiling the source code.

To compile, I personally recommend using Eclipse or NetBeans. 
Firstly, create an empty project; 
Secondly, import the source code and external libraries; 
Thirdly, bind external libraries to the building path; 
Finally, compile and run.

Note the current version of the tool is very basic and immature, I am still refining and expanding it.
It is not ready for share yet.

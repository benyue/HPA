# HPA
This is a demo tool for presenting the implementation of several model checking algorithms based on the model of Hierarchical Probabilistic Automata (HPA). Given a certain probability threshold, checking emptiness is decidable for 1-HPA but undecidable for k-HPA where k>=2. Our algorithms automatically decide the emptiness result for certain failure prone concurrent web examples, which are abstracted as models of HPA and with customized failures.  

HPA_(version).jar is the single executable file. You can download it to your computer and run it.

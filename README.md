# HPA
This is a demo tool for presenting the implementation of several model checking algorithms based on the model of Hierarchical Probabilistic Automata (HPA). Given a certain probability threshold, checking emptiness is decidable for 1-HPA but undecidable for k-HPA where k>=2. Our algorithms automatically decide the emptiness result for certain failure prone concurrent web examples, which are abstracted as models of HPA and with customized failures. 

[Quick Valuation]
please visit the following webpage (IE browser recommended):
http://www.cs.uic.edu/~yben/tools/HPA/dist_demo/launch.html
and click Launch.
This webpage and tool version is specially prepared for quick valuation of the HPA tool, with preloaded examples ready for Verification, and easy access to online examples.

[Installation]
HPA_(version).jar is the single executable file of the tool. Download it to your computer and run. 
Or allternatively, download and run the HAP_(version).jnlp file, which will download the latest version of the Jar file.

For direct online access to the tool, please visit the following webpage (IE browser recommended):
http://www.cs.uic.edu/~yben/tools/HPA/dist/launch.html
and click Launch.
//Note in some cases, the internet browser may download the jnlp file instead of opening it, then just run it as an executable file.

For whichever installation method above,
- Make sure you have latest Jave installed.
- Update your Java's security settings to add "http://www.cs.uic.edu" in the exception website list.
- For Mac OS, bypass security settings for the app:
  Search "How to open an app from a unidentified developer and exempt it from Gatekeeper"

# HPA
This is a demo tool for presenting the implementation of several model checking algorithms based on the model of Hierarchical Probabilistic Automata (HPA). Given a certain probability threshold, checking emptiness is decidable for 1-HPA but undecidable for k-HPA where k>=2. Our algorithms automatically decide the emptiness result for certain failure prone concurrent web examples, which are abstracted as models of HPA and with customized failures. 

[Manual]
Web version provided. Please download the compressed manual folder at this website, or access online Manual at:
http://www.cs.uic.edu/~yben/tools/HPA/Manual_html/Manual.htm

[Prerequisite]

- Make sure you have latest Jave installed.
- Update your Java's security settings to add "http://www.cs.uic.edu" in the exception website list.

[Installation]

For direct online access to the tool, please visit the following webpage (IE browser recommended):
http://www.cs.uic.edu/~yben/tools/HPA/dist/launch.html
and click Launch.

In some cases, the internet browser may download the jnlp file instead of opening it, depending on the file assoiation of jnlp on your computer. If so, just download the jnlp file, then run it as an executable file/app.

For Mac OS, because of its security setting, you may not be able to access the app on-line. Instead, you have to DOWNLOAD the executable file (either the JAR file or JNLP file), from this webpage or the two evaluation webpages provided above. Then you need to bypass the security settings for the app: 
1) In Finder, Control-click or right click the icon of the app. 
2) Select Open from the top of contextual menu that appears. 
3) Click Open in the dialog box. If prompted, enter an administrator name and password. 
//For mode details, please search "How to open an app from a unidentified developer and exempt it from Gatekeeper" on webpage https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491.

If you are not familiar with Git, please click "Download Zip" on the home page of the project to download everything including examples.

FAT is an external tool to present generated PA (and HPA) graphically.
All the three files in this folder are the same tool with different deployment settings.
The intermediate files that are generated by the HPA tool and named with prefix "FAT_" are FAT tool compatible.
Note not all information in the PA are presented in FAT.
